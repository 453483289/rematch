# rematch

REmatch, a simple binary diffing utility that just works. 

Atleast, we hope it will be. Rematch is still a work in progress and is not fully functional at the moment.
We're currently working on bringing up basic funcionality. Check us out again soon, or watch for updates!

# Goal of REmatch

The goal of REmatch is to act as a maintained, extendable, open source tool for advanced assembly function-level binary comparison and matching. Hopefully, this will be a completely open source and free (as in speech) community-driven tool.

We've noticed that although there are more than several existing binary matching tools, there's no one tool that provides all of the following:

1. Open source and community driven
2. Supports advanced matching algorithms (ML included â„¢)
3. Fully integrated into IDA
4. Allows managing multiple projects in a single location
5. enables out of the box one vs. many matches
6. actively maintained

# Current state (30th of August, 2016)

Development advances on a daily basis. We have a basic server and an IDA plugin. We collect a few relatively simple features and working on adding more. We have a matching stab that we will populate soon. Features are uploaded to the server. Basic plugin settings, project hierarchy and user authentication. We have a skeleton for the match results dialog (which supports some basic python scripting! :D).
